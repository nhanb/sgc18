    Born in 2014 with the mission to improve the Vietnamese fighting game
    scene, the Street Fighter Vietnam community based in Hồ Chí Minh City
    worked together to organize an international fighting game tournament right
    in Vietnam - a feat that no other domestic organizer managed to achieve.
    With Capcom's support, 2017 marks the third year Saigon Cup has been
    officially included in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="http://capcomprotour.com/schedule/">Capcom Pro Tour</a>, thus
    attracting top-level players from all over the world. 2017 is also the
    first year Saigon Cup becomes a multi-game tournament, with Guilty Gear Xrd
    Revelator and Blazblue Central Fiction joining the lineup.
